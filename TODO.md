# Features:
 - Timer for players
 - Border around player screen on time to click

 - Advanced features for host
    - Specify how old categories can be
    - "Report" bad questions

- Host/board fade modal on timeout
- Use message/alert to show answerer and plus/minus
- Need to add functionality to the host to rejoin with cookies (like player)
- Leave room option


# Missing actual functionality
 [ ] Final Jeopardy / Tiebreakers
 [ ] Daily Doubles

# Bugs I guess
- Technically the show number in the database includes all types.
    - i.e. Show 1 is Season 1 Show 1 ***AND*** Super Jeopardy Show 1...
- On Final Jeopardy game automatically loads final question on both host and board. Need to allow wagers, and category display and stuff
- Remove player numbers from game setup (in the HTML)
- Wager rules all follow DD, not specifically FJ/TB rounds.
